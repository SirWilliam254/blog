Hello World.


"Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step indeed", a wise man coined. This marks my first step into the journey of becoming a competent Data Analyst.

## The Future
Our world is gradually evolving to become more technology reliant, and one of the technologies expected to revolutionize the future is machine leaning.
From trivial jobs to sophisticated services, almost everything today is using machine learning.
There has been an exponential development in computational power, a huge increase in data, and advancement in processor architecture. This has created a conducive environment for AI to thrive.
Machine Learning if properly harnessed it promises to create a vastly more productive economy by 
automating repetitive tasks, reducing human errors, predicting future values/ occurrences and keeping track of many components in a system.

AI is more profound than any other technology currently in the market.
The development of systems using machine learning will help us concentrate on more important tasks
rather than boring and unproductive repetitive tasks.


>“For getting success in business with Data Science, predictions must be backed by timely strategic actions.”.

Having recently completed my bachelor’s degree in Science (Statistics and Programming). I believe this will serve me as a solid foundation to venturing into the world of data science, machine learning and AI.


Most of the projects will encompass but not limited to finance, time series and geospatial analytics.

The main technologies that we will be incorporating:
* R-Studio
* SQL
* Python
* Rapid miner
* SAS

This blog marks the beginning of that journey.

So help me God.
