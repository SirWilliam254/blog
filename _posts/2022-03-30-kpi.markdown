# Setting up one

Having good KPIs can make a huge impact on the business and its processes, so how do we set one up.

- Selecting a timeframe, i.e., whether; daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly etc. given the business model.

-	Identify your goals and objectives: The first step in setting up KPIs is to identify what you want to achieve. This might include business goals, such as increasing revenue or improving customer satisfaction, or personal goals, such as increasing productivity or improving work-life balance.

-	Identify the key performance indicators that align with your goals: Once you have identified your goals, the next step is to identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that can help you track your progress towards those goals. These might include financial metrics, such as revenue growth or profitability, or non-financial metrics, such as customer satisfaction or employee retention.

- Establish the metrics that you will need to use in order to demonstrate and measure each trait.

-	Establish baseline values: Before you can begin tracking your KPIs, you'll need to establish baseline values. This will give you a starting point to measure your progress against.

-	Set targets: Once you have established baseline values, the next step is to set targets for each KPI. These targets should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

- Teamwork; make sure everyone is on the same page and strategize on the best way to strategize.

- Finally, Monitor and review your KPIs regularly: It's important to regularly track and review your KPIs to see how you are progressing towards your goals. This might involve collecting data, analyzing trends, and making adjustments as needed.
