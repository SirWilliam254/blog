# Time Series Analysis.


"Predicting the future is easy... It's trying to figure out what's going on now that's hard!"

Data that is gathered over time at regular intervals are analyzed using the statistical technique known as time series analysis. It entails examining patterns and trends in the data to comprehend the underlying causes of those patterns. Time series analysis is frequently utilized in many disciplines, including signal processing, finance, economics, and weather forecasting.


### It can be used to predict

- Sales and revenue based on past trends and seasonality.

- Stock prices based on historical trends and market conditions.

- Economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment rates.

- Weather patterns based on past climate data.

- Traffic patterns on highways and other transportation systems based on historical data.

- Demand for products and services based on past trends and seasonality.

- Energy consumption based on historical data and weather patterns.

- Web traffic to a website based on historical data and seasonality patterns.

- Resource utilization such as server usage, network bandwidth, and storage capacity based on past trends.

- Customer churn rates based on historical data and customer behavior patterns.

- Marketing campaigns impact on sales based on historical data and campaign performance.

- Patient health outcomes based on past medical records and patient data.

- Manufacturing output based on past production data and demand trends



### Time Series Patterns

- `Trend`, trend is a long-term increase or decrease in the data over time. It can be linear or nonlinear.

- `Seasonality`, seasonality refers to a pattern that repeats over a fixed time interval, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.

- `Cyclical`, cyclical patterns are similar to seasonality, but they occur over a longer time frame and may not have a fixed interval. For example, business cycles that last several years can exhibit cyclical patterns.

- `Irregular`, irregular patterns are random fluctuations that cannot be explained by a trend, seasonality, or cyclical pattern. They can be caused by unpredictable events, measurement errors, or other factors.

- `Level`, the level of a time series refers to the average value of the series over time. A level pattern can occur when the series has a constant average value.

- `Noise`, noise refers to random fluctuations in the data that do not have any underlying pattern. It can be caused by measurement errors, sampling variability, or other sources of random variation.

- `Autocorrelation`, this occurs when the values of a time series are correlated with their past values. Autocorrelation can indicate a trend or a cyclical pattern in the data.

- `Stationarity`, a time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties, such as its mean and variance, do not change over time. Stationarity is an important property for many time series models, as non-stationary data can be difficult to model and forecast.

- `Outliers`, these are extreme values in the data that are significantly different from the other values. Outliers can be caused by measurement errors, data entry errors, or other factors. They can affect the accuracy of forecasts and should be identified and removed or corrected if possible.

- `Change points`, these are points in time where the pattern of the time series changes abruptly. Change points can be caused by changes in underlying processes or external factors, and they can make it difficult to model and forecast the data.

- `Regime shifts`, they occur when the statistical properties of a time series change over time, such as its mean or variance. Regime shifts can be caused by changes in underlying processes, external factors, or shifts in the way the data is collected or reported.

#### NB

Change point and regime shift are similar in the sense that they both represent a significant shift or change in the underlying pattern of a time series. However, the difference between the two lies in the duration and nature of the change.A change point is a sudden change or shift in the mean or variance of a time series, which can occur due to a variety of reasons such as an external shock or a change in the underlying process. Change points are typically short-lived and do not have a lasting impact on the overall pattern of the time series.
wheareas, a regime shift represents a more fundamental change in the underlying process that generates the time series. Regime shifts are typically longer-lived and can have a lasting impact on the pattern of the time series. Examples of regime shifts include changes in economic policies, technological innovations, or demographic shifts.
