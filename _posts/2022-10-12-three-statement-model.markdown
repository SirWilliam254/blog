### What is it?

3 statement modeling is a financial modeling technique used to create a comprehensive financial model of a company. It involves building projections for a company's income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement over a period of time, typically 3 to 5 years.

The income statement projects a company's revenues, costs, and expenses, and shows the company's profitability. The balance sheet projects a company's assets, liabilities, and equity, and shows the company's financial position. The cash flow statement projects a company's cash inflows and outflows, and shows how the company is generating and using cash.

3 statement modeling is used in a variety of contexts, including corporate finance, investment banking, and financial analysis. It is often used to forecast a company's financial performance, to assess the feasibility of a business plan, or to evaluate the potential returns of an investment.

To build a 3 statement model, you'll need to gather financial data for the company, including historical financial statements, industry benchmarks, and any other relevant information. You'll also need to make assumptions about the company's future performance, including factors such as revenue growth, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. Using these inputs, you can build projections for each of the three financial statements and use them to calculate key metrics such as net income, return on investment, and cash flow.
