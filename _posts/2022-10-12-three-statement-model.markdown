### What is it?

3 statement modeling is a financial modeling technique used to create a comprehensive financial model of a company. It involves building projections for a company's income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement over a period of time, typically 3 to 5 years.

The income statement projects a company's revenues, costs, and expenses, and shows the company's profitability. The balance sheet projects a company's assets, liabilities, and equity, and shows the company's financial position. The cash flow statement projects a company's cash inflows and outflows, and shows how the company is generating and using cash.

3 statement modeling is used in a variety of contexts, including corporate finance, investment banking, and financial analysis. It is often used to forecast a company's financial performance, to assess the feasibility of a business plan, or to evaluate the potential returns of an investment.

To build a 3 statement model, you'll need to gather financial data for the company, including historical financial statements, industry benchmarks, and any other relevant information. You'll also need to make assumptions about the company's future performance, including factors such as revenue growth, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. Using these inputs, you can build projections for each of the three financial statements and use them to calculate key metrics such as net income, return on investment, and cash flow.

### How its Helps investors and buyers

-	Helps to understand a company's financial position: By building a 3 statement model, investors and buyers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of a company's financial position, including its profitability, liquidity, and financial stability.

-	Facilitates financial analysis: 3 statement modeling can help investors and buyers to perform a range of financial analyses, including ratio analysis, discounted cash flow analysis, and scenario analysis. These analyses can provide valuable insights into a company's financial performance and potential returns.

-	Improves decision making: By providing a more detailed view of a company's financials, 3 statement modeling can help investors and buyers to make more informed decisions about whether to invest in or acquire a company. It can also help to identify potential risks or challenges that the company may face in the future.

-	Facilitates negotiations: 3 statement modeling can also be useful in negotiations, as it can provide a basis for discussing the financial terms of an investment or acquisition. It can also help to identify areas where adjustments or concessions may be necessary.
