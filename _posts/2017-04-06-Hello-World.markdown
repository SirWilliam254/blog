Hello World.


"Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step indeed", a wise man coined. This marks my first step into the journey of becoming a competent Machine learning Engineer.

## The Future
Our world is gradually evolving to become more technology reliant, and one of the technologies expected to revolutionize the future is machine leaning.
From trivial jobs to sophisticated services, almost everything today is using machine learning.
There has been an exponential development in computational power, a huge increase in data, and advancement in processor architecture. This has created a conducive environment for AI to thrive.
Machine Learning if properly harnessed it promises to create a vastly more productive economy by 
automating repetitive tasks, reducing human errors, predicting future values/ occurrences and keeping track of many components in a system.

AI is more profound than any other technology currently in the market.
The development of systems using machine learning will help us concentrate on more important tasks
rather than boring and unproductive repetitive tasks.


>“For getting success in business with Data Science, predictions must be backed by timely strategic actions.”.

Having recently completed my bachelor’s degree in Science (Statistics and Programming). I believe this will serve me as a solid foundation to venturing into the world of data science, machine learning and AI.


Working on a project alone can be hectic and not quite as rewarding. Thus this projects I will be working side by side with a colleague in the same field, who goes by the name Ian Mureithi. So as to maximize productivity and have different perspectives towards any problem.
We will be working mostly with; Medical data, Time series + financial data and data from sensors.


The main technologies that we will be incorporating:
* R-Studio
* SQL
* Python
* Rapid miner
* SAS

This blog marks the beginning of that journey.

So help us God.
