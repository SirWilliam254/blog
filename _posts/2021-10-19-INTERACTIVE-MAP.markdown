Geospatial data, which is also reffered to as geodata usually consists of locational information connected to a dataset. For instance address, city or ZIP code. Geospatial data can also come from Global Positioning System (GPS) data, geospatial satellite imagery, telematics devices, IoT and geotagging
## Brief History of Geospatial
One of the biggest moments in geospatial history was the launch of Google Maps in 2005. It made mapping technology available to a mass audience.

But the seeds for what we know of geospatial technology today were first planted in 1832. During a cholera outbreak in Paris that year, French cartographer Charles Picquet created one of the first heat maps to show where the incidents of illness were concentrated.

When cholera struck London in 1854, physician John Snow built upon the Paris example. In addition to making a map that depicts the location of cholera deaths, he used spatial analysis of the data to show the connection between contaminated water sources and cholera.

By the early 1900s, photozincography was invented. It was a form of map printing with separate layers. Each layer could visually represent data on the map.

In the 1960s, Roger Tomlinson pioneered the concept of a Geographic Information System (GIS) that took traditional cartography to a new level. The advent of satellites focused on national security, scientific, and commercial ventures provided images of the Earthâ€™s surface and human activity for the first time, opening up more ways to visualize data. A GIS combines a base map with the capture, manipulation and management of data. A GIS map can contain unlimited amounts of data. This geospatial data not only lets users visualize and analyze the data, it helps users better understand trends, relationships and patterns.

GIS was further refined until the early 2000s when Google Maps produced a user-friendly version for the masses in 2005.

Since then, geospatial technology has evolved from the desktop to a cloud-based system. Geospatial databases used to be proprietary but open source software has changed that, making access to this type of information more widespread.
